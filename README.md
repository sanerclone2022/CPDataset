## 2. Basic Information

​		The resource in this repository is a dataset which contains 24,672 piars of matched changes and 38,041 non-matched changes.

​		The dataset was collected from 51 popular open-source Java projects. `basic_info.csv` details the information of these projects.

​		`consistent.csv`and `inconsistent.csv` contains matched change pairs and non-matched change pairs seperately.

​		`json` folder contains the resource files of each project.

​		`web` folder contains a web project which can be used to show the genealogy of a clone pair.

### 2.1 Matched and non-matched changes
​		File ```consistent.csv```(or ```inconsistent.csv```) contains all the matched(or non-matched) changes. The meaning of the headers lists as below:
+ project: which project does the data belongs to
+ groupId: the group id of the clone pair from which the data extracted
+ clone type: the type of the clone pair before changed
+ consistId: incremental id of the dataset
+ consistGroup: ids of the matched clone pair. In one certain clone pair genealogy, the entity of the clone instance in each revision was given an unique number. Suppose a consistGroup like 3#4, if it is a matched change pair, it means that instance marked as 3 and instantce marked as 4 both experienced the same change, if it is a non-matched change, it means that instance marked as 3 changed while instance marked as 4 experienced a different change or non-changed.
+ fileNum: 1 means the clone pair locates in the same file, 2 means the clone pair locates in different files.
### 2.2 Resouce of the dataset
​		The genealogy of each clone pair is stored in json file, which could be visualized in the web page. Here gives an instruction of the usage of these resources.

​		The above figure shows a matched change pair from dbeaver. It was extracted from the genealogy of clone pair 10585. Before changed, the clone pair was a type2 clone and the two instances were located in the same source file. Then, we open the web page CloneCoChange.html, select dbeaver and input 10585, the web shows a page as the picture below.

​		The picture above shows a clone genealogy of clone pair 10585. Each column presents an evolution timeline of one clone instance, each row presents the source code of  two clone instance in the same revision. 

​		As shown in the figure, the ids of the matched change pair were marked by blue circle, meaning that these two codes did the same change.
