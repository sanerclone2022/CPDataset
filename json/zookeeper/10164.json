Also added reconnection attempts if connection to leader lost.\n\nIn this PR I rebased the changes on the current master.  resolving some minor conflicts with:\n- [ZOOKEEPER-3296](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3296): Explicitly closing the sslsocket when it failed handshake to prevent issue where peers cannot join quorum\n- [ZOOKEEPER-3320](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3320): Leader election port stop listen when hostname unresolvable for some time\n- [ZOOKEEPER-3385](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3385): Add admin command to display leader\n- [ZOOKEEPER-3386](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3386): Add admin command to display voting view\n- [ZOOKEEPER-3398](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3398): Learner.connectToLeader() may take too long to time-out\n\nI still want to test the feature manually (e.g. using docker containers with multiple virtual networks / interfaces). The steps to the manual test could be recorded in the [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iGVwxeHp57qogwfdodCh9b32P2_kOQaJZ2GDo7j36fI/edit?usp=sharing) as well.\n\nAlso I think we could add a few more unit tests where we are using multiple addresses. The current tests are using a single address only.\n\nAlso the Zookeeper documentation needs to be changed (e.g. by a follow-up Jira?) to promote the new feature and the new config format (possibly including also the admin command documentation in relation with [ZOOKEEPER-3386](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3386) and [ZOOKEEPER-3461](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3461))\n\nAuthor: Mate Szalay-Beko <szalay.beko.mate@gmail.com>\nAuthor: Mate Szalay-Beko <mszalay@cloudera.com>\n\nReviewers: eolivelli@apache.org.  andor@apache.org\n\nCloses #1048 from symat/ZOOKEEPER-3188 and squashes the following commits:\n\n3c6fc52d7 [Mate Szalay-Beko] Merge remote-tracking branch 'apache/master' into ZOOKEEPER-3188\n356882d46 [Mate Szalay-Beko] ZOOKEEPER-3188: document new configuration format for using multiple addresses\n45b6c0fdb [Mate Szalay-Beko] Merge remote-tracking branch 'apache/master' into ZOOKEEPER-3188\n4b6bcea48 [Mate Szalay-Beko] ZOOKEEPER-3188: MultiAddress unit tests for Quorum TLS and Kerberos/Digest authentication\n40bc44c23 [Mate Szalay-Beko] Merge remote-tracking branch 'apache/master' into ZOOKEEPER-3188\nf875f5c67 [Mate Szalay-Beko] Merge remote-tracking branch 'apache/master' into ZOOKEEPER-3188\n31805e79b [Mate Szalay-Beko] Merge remote-tracking branch 'apache/master' into ZOOKEEPER-3188\n0f95678ca [Mate Szalay-Beko] ZOOKEEPER-3188: skip unreachable addresses when Learner connects to Leader\ne232c55da [Mate Szalay-Beko] ZOOKEEPER-3188: fix flaky unit MultiAddress unit test\ne892d8d8e [Mate Szalay-Beko] Merge remote-tracking branch 'apache/master' into ZOOKEEPER-3188\n6f2ab755f [Mate Szalay-Beko] Merge remote-tracking branch 'apache/master' into ZOOKEEPER-3188\n2eedf2687 [Mate Szalay-Beko] ZOOKEEPER-3188: fix PR commits;
