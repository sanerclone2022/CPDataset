Sorry for the churn.  but after this things should be settled down for a while (and we'll be launching v20 soon!). Changes include:\n\n-Revert the interface names back. \"BasicGraph\" is now \"Graph\" (BasicGraph was probably a a poor choice).  and \"Graph\" is now \"ValueGraph\". The \"node only\" Graph interface is at the top of the interface hierarchy.  and ValueGraph extends it.\n-To facilitate the above.  the various graph interfaces do *not* specify equality.  and the default implementations use reference (identity) equality.\n-Add static methods Graphs.equivalent(...) for users that want value-based equality.\n-Rename Endpoints to EndpointPair. Rename nodeA()/nodeB() to nodeU()/nodeV() and expose isOrdered().\n\nMinor changes:\n\n-Undid the small refactor from [] since the original structure makes it easier for the Immutable classes to have the right hierarchy (i.e. ImmutableValueGraph extends ImmutableGraph.  ImmutableNetwork.asGraph() is an ImmutableGraph).\n-Added an \"isEquivalentTo\" method to NetworkSubject (formerly GraphSubject) in labs. Eventually we should get around to having a single truth import for both Graphs and Networks.\n-------------\nCreated by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe\nMOE_MIGRATED_REVID=131906631\n","date":"2016-09-01 22:30:43","modifiedFileCount":"34","status":"M","submitter":"jasexton"}]
